## Problem Statement
Wireless networks face increasing cyber threats, such as rogue access points, intrusions, and client misbehavior. Current security measures are often inadequate. This project aims to develop a cost-effective Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) using a Raspberry Pi to detect, prevent, and respond to these threats in real-time, focusing on the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard.
